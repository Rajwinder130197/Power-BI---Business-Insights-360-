Here's the intersting part, there is a sactter chart that shows the performance of regions based on Net sales and GM % however I  added a slicer which will help stakeholders to find out which region reach up to the target with speceifc percentage. For example- if you want to see which market reach up to 10 % of the target. you just have to  drag the slicer to 10% and it will show the markets that reach up to that goal.
